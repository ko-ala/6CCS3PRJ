/**

@page callbacks  Callback Functions

With the new v3.0 API @em RNAlib introduces so-called callback mechanisms for several functions.

This enables users of our library not only to retrieve computed data without the need
for parsing complicated data structures, but also allows one to tweak our implementation
to do additional tasks without the requirement of a re-implementation of basic algorithms.

Our implementation of the callback mechanisms always follows the same scheme:
The user:
- defines a function that complies with the interface we've defined, and
- passes a pointer to said function to our implementations

In addition to the specific arguments of our callback interfaces, virtually all callbacks
receive an additional @em pass-through-pointer as their last argument. This enables one
to:
- encapsulate data, and
- provide thread-safe operations,

since this pointer is simply passed through by our library functions. It may therefore hold
the address of an arbitrary, user-defined data structure.

Below, you find an enumeration of the individual callback functions that are available
in RNAlib.
