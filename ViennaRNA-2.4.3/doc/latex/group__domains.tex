\subsection{Detailed Description}
This module covers simple and straight-\/forward extensions to the R\+NA folding grammar. 

Some applications of R\+NA secondary structure prediction require an extension of the {\itshape regular} R\+NA folding grammar. For instance one would like to include proteins and other ligands binding to unpaired loop regions while competing with conventional base pairing. Another application could be that one may want to include the formation of self-\/enlosed structural modules, such as G-\/quadruplexes. For such applications, we provide a pair of additional domains that extend the regular R\+NA folding grammar, \hyperlink{group__domains__struc}{Structured domains} and \hyperlink{group__domains__up}{Unstructured domains}.

While unstructured domains are usually determined by a more or less precise sequence motif, e.\+g. the binding site for a protein, structured domains are considered self-\/enclosed modules with a more or less complex pairing pattern. Our extension with these two domains introduces two production rules to fill additional dynamic processing matrices {\ttfamily S} and {\ttfamily U} where we store the pre-\/computed contributions of structured domains ({\ttfamily S}), and unstructured domains ({\ttfamily U}).

For the sake of flexibility, each of the domains is associated with a specific data structure serving as an abstract interface to the extension. The interface uses callback functions to (i) pre-\/compute arbitrary data, e.\+g. filling up additional dynamic programming matrices, and (ii) evaluate the contribution of a paired or unpaired structural feature of the R\+NA. Implementations of these callbacks are separate for regular free energy evaluation, e.\+g. M\+FE prediction, and partition function applications. A data structure holding arbitrary data required for the callback functions can be associated to the domain as well. While R\+N\+Alib comes with a default implementation for structured and unstructured domains, the system is entirely user-\/customizable.
